# Using as Transmitter
Sending and receiving.   
I tested it with [this](https://github.com/nopnop2002/esp-idf-rf69/tree/main/ArduinoCode/RadioHead69_RawDemo_PONG).   

Using as Receiver
Send back the received data.   
I tested it with [this](https://github.com/nopnop2002/esp-idf-rf69/tree/main/ArduinoCode/RadioHead69_RawDemo_PING).
